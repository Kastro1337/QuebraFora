# list of bugs found in the game
#

1. The score disappear when the right-bottom brick is height
  Cause:  Unknown
  Fix:    Unknown

2. Ball go into two bricks and break many bricks in the same movement
  Cause:  the ball Dy is allways inverted on hit, causing the ball to bounce weird
  Fix:  when the ball hit the top/bottom of the brick, invert Dy. when the ball hit the
        Left/right of the brick invert the Dx

3. When keyUping, the paddle will stop for miliseconds, player wont be able to change direction quickly
  Cause: makes the paddle.dx = 0
  fix: maybe change the way the paddle movement works
